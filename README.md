<h1>Important Compatibility Request Information</h1>
<p>If there's a resource pack that doesn't work properly with ResourceFix, try to load it under ResourceFix, or try using one of the existing patches with this.</p>
<h2>If that doesn't work</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Open a bug report and choose the "ResourceFix Compatibility Request" option.</li>
  <li>Follow the request template.</li>
  <li>I will get to you as soon as possible with a working solution.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Have you ever wanted to run your favorite resource pack on 1.12.2 or below?</h1>
<p>Probably, and the results are that it doesn't work. However, recently I forced myself into making a resource pack that remaps block models for you, so you can run your favorite resource packs on 1.12.2 or below without many issues</p>
<h2>Is this perfect and does it work?</h2>
<p>By any means this isn't perfect, but it mostly works and I really liked the results that I managed to achieve.</p>
<h2>How stable is this?</h2>
<p>Partially stable, don't use any of the packs listed in the "Incompatible" section of this description.</p>
<b>Please note that most packs will work, however some might need additional tweaks to work properly.</b>
<p>If you use a pack that's incompatible, you might experience missing textures, crashes or rendering issues. More clarification will be below.</p>
<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<i>Please note that I haven't tested everything so there will be a bit of a gray area regarding some packs.</i>
<h3>Packs that change item textures</h3>
<p>Incompatible for now, I have plans to add item support later.</p>
<h3>Block textures or models</h3>
<p>Fully compatible if BlockStates or CTM isn't utilized.</p>
