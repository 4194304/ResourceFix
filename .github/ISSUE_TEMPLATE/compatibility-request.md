<p>Please provide a link to your resource pack with a link or as an attached file.</p>
<h3>What went wrong?</h3>
<p>Provide screenshots if possible or a simple description of what went wrong.</p>
<p>For crashes, look through your game logs at %appdata%\.minecraft\crash-reports. For MultiMC or Prism, head to Edit Instance -> Other Logs to find it. It should be a crash report if it was a crash. Copy the crash log and head to mclo.gs. Then copy the contents of the log there and copy the link once it processes the log successfully.</p>
